I have a long tradition of having [a Week of Freedom]({% post_url archive/2016-07-19-faroes %}) between jobs. This was kind of an unplanned one, I guess? I booked it as a regular digital nomad holiday, but it turned into the WoF after I switched horses on pretty short notice, from the startup world straight back into a _much improved_ version of my old role.

This was my first time on Fuerteventura, though not the first on the Canary Islands: I already [visited Tenerife before]({% post_url archive/2016-10-23-tangled %}), twice.

We booked two weeks, originally planning to do all the tourist things on the first week, then work from our apartment and enjoy the weather & good food in the evenings for the rest of the time.

For the first half of the holiday we had access to a car and drove it up and down the length of the island, seriously putting it through the paces. We visited everywhere, from the farthest point of Jandia all the way up to Popcorn beach up in the North.

The landscape here is quite different from Tenerife, much more arid and desert-like. The main event is the beaches and mountain ranges, with many lighthouses dotted around the coast, and big tidal areas with interesting vegetation to explore.

The second week, given my job switcharoo, I didn't end up working, as originally planned. Instead, I went around mostly by myself, climbing [ Fuerteventura's tallest peak La Zarza]({% post_url 2021-11-30-cofete-la-zarza %}) and generally just resting, cooking, reading lots and going for swims.

It was a very satisfying reset after a stressful couple of months, and got me mentally ready to go into a much better role where I feel valued and respected. 

This holiday was an awesome start to an exciting new beginning. May it last.
