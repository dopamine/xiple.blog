We chose the most scorching hot day to take the ferry from Perth, Western Australia out to Wadjemup, land of the Whadjuk people, more frequently known as Rottnest Island. 

The week preceding our day trip was a blur of socialising, to the point where I was feeling distinctly frazzled and in desperate need of some alone/couple's time in nature. And Rotto delivered.

After a pleasant hour and a half scenic ferry ride, we arrived at the main settlement and picked up our rented bikes to ride around. The island is mostly car-free, which adds to its charm, and riding around on bikes was a great way to take it all in. 

Probably due to my social-burnout-fuelled anxiety about the heat and my own lack of fitness, I was worried that I would keel over with the undulating landscape, but I ended up making it around the whole challenging, sweat-drenched 22kms of the island circuit just fine.

We stopped at one of the beaches for a dip, the water a perfect shade of turquoise, and deliciously cooling.

Next time (and hopefully there will be a next time) I'll come more prepared: a pop-up beach shelter or parasol for shade, an esky, flippers and snorkelling goggles, and of course some long sleeve rashies, so I can explore these crystal clear coves at length.

I was pretty scared of catching a bad sunburn, correctly anticipating that there would be no shade whatsoever on the islandâ€¦ but despite the relentless sun, we somehow managed to stay on top of the factor 50 and I got back without even a tinge of pink.

After our swim, we headed to a beer garden for some drinks and to take a break from the sun. 

While I managed to catch a glimpse of the quokkas in their natural habitat earlier (a fair way off, foraging underneath some shrubbery, just the way I wanted to see them), it was here that I got to observe them at closer quarters, as there were a couple of them peacefully grazing around us while we sipped on our LLBs. Thankfully the tourists left them well alone.

With the sun climbing lower and lower in the sky, we hopped back on the ferry and enjoyed another beautiful ride back up the Swan River to Perth. The shallow light bathing the banks of the river just kept getting better and better, and by the time we got back to Elizabeth Quay, the sunset was in full swing. 

We found a thai place nearby, managed to nab an excellent al fresco spot to enjoy the show as the sun dipped behind the buildings of the CBD and Kings Park.
