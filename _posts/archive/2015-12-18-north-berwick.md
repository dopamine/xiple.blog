title: "Winter light in North Berwick"

A beautiful thing about winters in Scotland is this stunning, otherworldly quality of the light that we often get during the shorter daylight hours.

It's a nice weekend pursuit to go chase the sun and see where you end up, even just familiar places. You might be surprised how different they can look. Views that you're well used to, like North Berwick's long beaches, can be completely transformed in the pale, shallow light during these shorter days.

Not many words today to go with the images. I mentioned that I got a new digital camera recently… I'm loving getting out there and recording life, then playing it back here. 

Sometimes it feels like I can just let the photos can do all the talking.
