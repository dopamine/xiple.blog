Just a few more holiday shots, this time of Tihany, perhaps the most popular tourist haunt on Lake Balaton.

Famous for its Benedictine abbey and surrounded by endless lavender fields, this pretty little historical town sits on a peninsula protruding well into the lake, the bays on its two sides teeming with sailboats. I don’t know if it’s the viewing angle or the water quality, but somehow the water always takes on this incredible shade of teal, a perfect colour to offset the white triangles.

Not much to say about our visit here, other than that it was postcard-pretty, and that the Echo Restaurant had incredible views, tolerable food, and a curious but very refreshing lavender cordial. 

Here’s some photos to boot:
