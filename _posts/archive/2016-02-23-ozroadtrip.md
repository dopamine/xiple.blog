The road from Melbourne to Canberra is a long, hypnotic and winding one, with nothing much along the way but acres of farmland as far as the eye can see. We managed to arrive in complete stealth and the big reveal was a huge success, all the family came together under one roof, and partied late into the warm summer night in the back yard.
