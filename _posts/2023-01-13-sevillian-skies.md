title:  "Sevillian sunset skies"
---

The academic year of 2009-10 was the year of sunsets for me. 

Most evenings for 10 months, I would sit out on our balcony in the Macarena district of Seville, and look out over the roofs to enjoy the change of light.

I must have taken hundreds upon hundreds of pictures of that simple view, same aerials but different clouds. These three are the only ones that remain.

It's been a simple pleasure, going over all this rescued data, backing up everything properly and sifting through all the digital artefacts of my previous lives. Some photos, I barely recognise myself or remember the events. 

But I remember every last one of the images with pretty skies and beloved views. It's nice to have a new home for all of them.
